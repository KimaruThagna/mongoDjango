Tutorial on using a mongoDB database with django
The app is a simple sample showing how a DRF app would be built on a mongo db database. 
One instance will use models and use djongo to perform migrations and save to mongoDB,
the other version will be a free-will version where there will be no predefined model. Data will be saved as is when it comes from the API.
The database server used is mlab to host the mongoDB instance.
